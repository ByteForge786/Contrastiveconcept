I'll provide brief definitions for each data type based on the images:

1. Market Data:
- Meaning: Simple observable information like prices, volumes, and volatilities that can be collected at specific points in time
- Purpose: To provide foundational market information that can be purchased/accessed by market participants

2. Operational Data:
- Meaning: Internal data defined within Nomura representing business processes, client hierarchies, and business events
- Purpose: To manage and support internal business activities and record business transactions

3. Reference Data:
- Meaning: External data about entities, people, instruments, and calendars that change very infrequently
- Purpose: To maintain a single standardized representation of external information for aggregating transactional data across business activities

4. Analytics Data:
- Meaning: Combined transaction/inventory and market data processed through mathematical models at specific points in time
- Purpose: To create advanced analytical representations of transactions/inventory that can be aggregated and reported in business-meaningful ways, such as for risk models
